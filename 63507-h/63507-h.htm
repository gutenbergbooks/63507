</div>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have on several occasions called attention to
the Power of Draw. It is a force which for good
as well as for evil pervades the whole social
system. Every centre of industry exerts this
attractive force by drawing to it large numbers of
persons for the sake of employment, and so far
the Draw acts beneficially. All our large towns are
in no small degree made up of individuals who
have drifted thither in the hope of exercising
their abilities for their own and the public advantage.
This is exactly as it should be. The world
is open to everybody. It is only a truism to say
that by the Power of Draw the uttermost ends of
the earth are peopled.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this subtle power in its pervading
energy is not limited to the industrious and well-disposed.
It is acutely demonstrated by all who
are looking about for the means of indulging in
a life of idleness at the cost of others. The disposition
to abstain from useful labour and to depend
less or more on gratuitous benefactions, has been
largely encouraged by mistaken views of what is
ordinarily called charity. The poor—no matter how
they happen to be poor—have been extolled as if
they were superior beings, to whom all must contribute
as one of the noblest of virtues. With perverted
notions of this kind, society has for ages done
everything in its power to consecrate and encourage
poverty, and no wonder it has attained to stupendous
dimensions. Early injunctions to give all to
the poor were followed by the piously inconsiderate
and wide-sweeping benefactions of the monasteries.
These in their turn were followed by the statutory
obligations of the poor-laws. And now there
is superadded a system of voluntary contribution
so extensive and varied as to dominate the
soundest principles of political economy, and which
in its general working amounts to a kind of communism.
By every large city, arrangements are
organised to succour every human need and infirmity.
Those who do not find it agreeable to work
will be fed—the feeding, perhaps, not being what
all would like, but pretty well as a make-shift.
For every species of ailment, from a broken leg to
diseased lungs, there is adequate provision. The
cultivation of thrift and self-respect not to be
thought of. Bad as things seem to have been in
the palmy days of the monasteries, they are now
in some quarters ten times worse. While one set
of people are slaving between death and life,
another set, determined to take their ease, keep
hovering on the verge of that agreeable category
the poor, and so contrive to lead a jolly sort of
existence.</p>

<p>Not that the so-called poor profess to be pure
idlers. For decency’s sake, they occasionally work
a little, and enjoy the commiseration of suffering
from the severity of winter, or from the commercial
depression arising from ‘bad times.’ On
such occasions the Power of Draw increases in
intensity; and now are offered favourable opportunities
for tender-hearted individuals to take a
lead in establishing soup-kitchens, or benefactions
thought to be equally creditable. It is melancholy
to consider how at times like these, so little real
good is done in comparison with the amount of
harm. We see, more particularly as regards the
young, the degree of suffering that is presently
assuaged, but take no account of the mischief
incurred by adding to the general demoralisation.
While philanthropists are fondly imagining that
they are doing much good, they are very probably
adding fresh accumulations to the already overgrown
mass of misery and crime. Not more surely
do hens run to the heap, than do the thriftless
and semi-pauperised instinctively flock towards
places where there is an inconsiderately lavish
distribution of charity. We never hear of a soup-kitchen
being set up, under however careful an
administration, without saying: ‘There goes a
distinct increase to the Power of Draw.’</p>

<p>The injury done by systems of profuse charity
has been frequently pointed out, but we have
seen nothing so effective and convincing on the
subject as a paper read by Mr Brace at the
American Social Science Congress of May 1874,
of which a copious abstract is given by a correspondent
in <i>The Times</i>, of January 24, in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>{274}</span>
present year. We think it may serve a good
purpose to present our readers with a few facts
from this interesting paper.</p>

<p>Referring to a serious depression in trade which
threw large numbers of persons out of work in
New York, plans were devised for giving temporary
support to the necessitous; the result being
that an encouragement was held out to idleness
and improvidence. ‘The experience of New York
in 1857’ (says Mr Brace), ‘and of Boston and other
cities since that date, proves that the soup-kitchen
charity only creates pauperism. Despite the warning
of the experienced, soup-kitchens and free
lodgings were opened by public and private means,
with the utmost liberality, in various portions of
New York last winter, and enormous sums were
contributed by private citizens for these popular
benefactions. Before the winter was over, however,
most of those engaged in them regretted,
without doubt, that they had ever taken part in
these kindly but mistaken charities. The reports
of competent observers shew what were their
effects. The announcement of the intended opening
of these and kindred charities immediately
called into the city the floating vagrants, beggars,
and paupers who wander from village to village
throughout the state. The streets of New York
became thronged with this ragged, needy crowd;
they filled all the station-houses and lodging-places
provided by private charity, and overflowed
into the island almshouses. Street-begging to the
point of importunity became a custom. Ladies
were robbed even on their own door-steps by
these mendicants. Petty offences such as thieving
and drunkenness increased. One of the free lodgings
in the upper part of the city established by
the Commissioners of Charities became a public
nuisance from its rowdyism and criminality.</p>

<p>Nor would these paupers work. On one occasion,
the almshouse authorities were discharging
a band of able-bodied paupers, and having need of
some light outdoor labour on the island, they
offered these men what is thought good country
wages—that is, fifteen dollars a month and board.
They unanimously refused, preferring the free lodgings
and free lunches of the city.’ Then, he adds,
came the attractive power—the Power of Draw.
‘Tramps came hurrying to the feast of charity,
honest and hard-working labouring men from
every part of the neighbouring country. Farms
in the state of New York were left stripped of
labourers, though the farmers offered good wages.
Working-men came from as far away as Pittsburg
and Boston, partly, no doubt, to see the sights of
New York, but hoping also for aid from public
and private charities. In some cases, young men
were arrested in criminal houses, who made their
headquarters in these soup-kitchens or relief-houses,
and then sallied out to enjoy the criminal
indulgences of the city.</p>

<p>The pauperising influences, however, of this
indiscriminate charity reached beyond these classes.
Poor families abandoned steady industry, got their
meals at the soup-kitchens, and spent the day in
going from one charitable organisation to another.
Those experienced with this class report that such
people acquire a “Micawber” habit of depending
on chances, and seldom return to constant work
again. Instances were known of families taking
their meals from the Relief Association and spending
the money set aside for this daily in liquor, so
that, in the poorest quarters the liquor-trade was
never so prosperous. A singular effect was also
produced on the class of homeless girls. Many
avoided the houses where charity was connected
with work, and obtained their meals at the free-lunch
places, and then lodged in the low cheap
lodging-houses, where their habits were uncontrolled
and they could wander the streets at night.
Many were thus enticed into ruin.</p>

<p>But another class now felt the pauperising
influence of this charity, one which had never
stooped to public alms before, the mechanics and
artisans. These were not driven by the severest
poverty. They had been in receipt of good wages,
and had much money laid up in the savings-banks.
They contributed through the winter large sums
to various strikes and labour unions. The best
proof that they were not pressed by poverty is
that never once did they lower their demand
for wages in any branch of industry. The most
ignorant job-work, as for instance a man’s labour
in moving, was fifty cents an hour. Few would
even clean snow from a side-walk or cut or saw
wood or carry burdens for less than at the rate of
two to two and a half dollars per diem. Mechanics
still demanded from three to five dollars per diem.
It was notorious that important trades, such as the
building-trade, were at a standstill on account of
high wages, and that the employing class could
not afford to pay such high rates. Yet no wages
came down. Labour was in struggle with capital
against a lowering of prices. Charity assisted labour
in the combat. The soup-kitchens and relief
associations of various names became thronged
with mechanics. Some of the best working-men
in the city ate and lodged at the public expense.
Thousands of able-bodied artisans, young and skilful,
were fed by alms. The idleness and dependence
injured many among them irretrievably.
The whole settlement of the labour question was
postponed by the over-generous charity of the city,
and spring came upon the mechanical class without
a revival of trade, which might have come if
misguided kindness had not supported them in
this struggle.</p>

<p>These benevolent institutions also interfered
with many kinds of legitimate business. Thus in
one ward, the eleventh, a number of small eating-house
keepers, who had made an honest living by
their occupation, were almost thrown into bankruptcy
by the competition of certain soup-kitchens
established by religious associations. A similar
thing occurred in other wards. In one district also,
a keeper of a laundry who had ten or twelve girls
in his employment at good wages, found himself
stripped of his help in the midst of the winter,
these women preferring to live for nothing in the
free lodgings. He accordingly was compelled to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>{275}</span>
advertise for help, but without success, and was
ultimately obliged to close his laundry.</p>

<p>It had been expected that this industrial crisis
would bring down the wages of female servants,
since these had remained at a high rate, though
all other prices had fallen. The superintendent of
the Free Labour Bureau, however, stated that
during all this distress, the poor girls who came
to his office could not be induced to take situations
for less than from fourteen to twenty dollars per
month, and said that they preferred to live at
the charitable institutions until they could get
such wages as they chose. It is well known that
the wages of female labour have been as high this
winter as at any time since the war. One of the
free dormitories for women was, in fact, broken
up by its coming to the knowledge of the directresses
that a lady on one occasion offered each
lodger a situation in a good family at ten dollars
per month, and not one of these “victims of
poverty” could be found who would accept the
place on the terms.’</p>

<p>One way and another an injury was done
through these pauperising influences which is
even now scarcely remedied. The drawing of
large numbers into the vortex of charity was in
all respects inexcusable; for if the heedlessly
benevolent had let matters alone, the more necessitous
would have found remunerative work in
quarters where labour was specially in demand.
It should never be forgotten that there is a principle
of readjustment in labour which tends to cure
local disorganisations. What philanthropists have
to do on pressing occasions like those mentioned
is to interpose no distracting element, such as the
temptation of free soup-kitchens, and to facilitate
removal to spots where industry can be advantageously
exercised.</p>

<p>In all the large cities in Great Britain we are
acquainted with, there are antiquated semi-ruinous
buildings in the alleys behind the main thoroughfares,
which were at one time occupied by the
affluent classes, but are now sunk to the condition
of resorts for the idle, the drunken, and the
dissolute, who habitually prey on society, and are a
torment to the public authorities. Attempts to root
out these dens of infamy and disease encounter a
resolute opposition from those who from usurious
motives have become the proprietors of such
places, and more especially does opposition come
from ratepayers who are shocked at the prospect
of paying some trifle annually in the shape of
an improvement tax. Antiquaries who have a
morbid fancy for old houses which will scarcely
hold together, and are as dark and unwholesome
as dungeons, also have their howl. So that it
is usually no easy matter to procure legislative
authority to put our towns generally on a decent
footing.</p>

<p>Let it be specially noted that narrow dingy
lanes are the centres of nearly all that is degrading
in towns whether large or small. The idle
and dissolute do not approve of living in the
face of day. They prefer to nestle in groups
behind-backs, as being there less likely to incur
observation. It is consistent with all experience
that just as a town abounds in narrow lanes,
it abounds in pauperism and every species of
iniquity. Clear away your lanes, and you correspondingly
lessen the number of the dangerous
classes. Every town, of course, must have dwellings
suitable for the less affluent in the community,
but in some way or other let all come to
the front. In England, the behind-backs ‘slums’
we speak of are known as courts, in Scotland they
are called closes; but whatever be their generic
designation, they are a nuisance and a scandal, for
they draw towards them, by under-currents of intelligence,
the dregs of the population from all
parts of the United Kingdom. Obviously, the attraction
is intensified by the succours of one sort or
other offered by public charities. What with holes
and corners to creep into out of sight, and with
the chance of coming in for a share of profuse
benevolences, the Draw is complete.</p>

<p>A number of years ago, when at the head of a
city municipality, we made a fair attempt, by
legislative measures, to sweep away the worst
class of closes, substituting for them open thoroughfares,
and likewise endeavoured to put the public
charities on a reasonably comprehensive footing.
The degree of success was moderate. From the
prevalence of narrow views, the ‘Improvement
Act’ was so materially restricted as to convey the
impression that, by ordinary forms of procedure,
in which loquacious and popularity hunting agitators
have their say, the improvement of towns on
a scale consistent with enlarged principles of sanitary
and social economy is barely practicable. In
vain you say of any special improvement that it
would clear away the haunts of the disreputable,
and at the same time lower the mortality to the
extent of eight or ten per thousand annually.
What is a lowering of the death-rate in comparison
with the obligation to pay an additional rate
of a penny per pound? Let things alone. The
inertia of systematic obstruction accordingly
prevails.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, as we speedily discovered,
there are vested interests in charities. Each
species of benevolence possesses an administrative
organisation of chairmen, secretaries, collectors,
and so forth, who with an affection for use and
wont, do not readily perceive how there can be
any advantage in a combination of distributive
bodies. If you throw twelve separate charities into
one, the officials connected with the eleven that
are set aside will necessarily suffer extinction.
There is a more cogent argument. Twelve collectors,
each with his separate book, have a better
chance of screwing money from householders than
one solitary collector. Besides, there are peculiar
fancies to be operated on. Some will contribute
to Dispensaries, who could not be wheedled into
subscribing for the support of a Soup-kitchen or
the distribution of coals. Collectors, like sportsmen,
know the bird they can bring down. In
these circumstances, all that came out of our poor
effort at combining charities was the establishment
of another administrative body with the function
of being a check on all descriptions of applicants.
That this ‘Association for Improving the Condition
of the Poor,’ has done some good by arresting promiscuous
charity, is we believe generally allowed.
On a similar plan there has been established in
the metropolis, a ‘Society for organising Charitable
Relief and Repressing Mendicity,’ which we
understand is working advantageously. It is
indeed chiefly by the rigid scrutiny which is so
organised, that the deserving poor can be properly
aided and the worthless repressed. On the public
at large, however, rests the responsibility of ridding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>{276}</span>
towns of their hosts of roughs and on-hangers; for
so long as mean haunts in obscure courts and
closes are suffered to exist, and while people indiscriminately
yield to importunities, so long will
be freely exercised the Power of Draw.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV.—A NEIGHBOURLY VISIT.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Jasper</span>, as he walked with dawdling gait back to
the morning-room—the ex-cavalry officer always
did dawdle, except in the hunting-field or when
race-horses were thundering past the judge’s chair—felt
what in his case did duty for brains to be
in a dizzy whirl. He could not grapple with the
mystery which seemed to have chosen Carbery
Chase for its headquarters. The captain was by
no means, as has been said, one of those guileless
youths, if such there be, who are slow to think
evil. Shew him a plain, intelligible, sordid
motive, and no one could be quicker in descrying
it, no matter how fair a pretence of decorous
honour might be kept up. But this was beyond
him. ‘No kith or kin of mine after all!’ he
muttered as he made his way along the thickly
carpeted corridor. ‘I must have been wrong,
absurdly wrong all the time. But why my father
should press me so hard on this subject no fellow
could understand. He’s in earnest though, about
desiring the match.’</p>

<p>As he spoke he laid his grasp on the handle
of the door of the morning-room, turned it, and
entering, found with a complacent smile, that
Ruth Willis was alone. Captain Denzil was on
sufficiently good terms with himself, but even
coxcombs are glad of the confirmatory suffrages of
others; and Jasper felt as though he were under
a sort of obligation to the baronet’s ward for
having paid him the compliment of falling in love
with him.</p>

<p>‘I thought,’ said Jasper, as if to apologise for
his presence in that pretty room, where a man
seemed incongruous with the surroundings, ‘that
my sisters were here.’</p>

<p>‘Shall I call them?’ asked Ruth, with that
sweet hypocrisy which girls only can exhibit, and
half-rising from the tiny work-table as she spoke.</p>

<p>‘Pray don’t. <i>I</i> have nothing on earth to say to
them, or indeed to anybody,’ said Jasper. ‘Life
drags at Carbery like wheels on a mud-plastered
road. Don’t you find it so too, Miss Willis?’</p>

<p>‘Indeed I do not,’ answered the Indian orphan,
taking up the cudgels gracefully in defence of her
guardian’s home. ‘I should be very ungrateful
if I did. It is not every day that a lonely little
thing like myself is taken into the house of a
kind dear family of new-old friends, who cherish
and protect, and pet and spoil her, as your good
father and sisters have done, Captain Denzil, to
poor little Ruth Willis.’</p>

<p>She said this so well, did Ruth, in a voice
that was slightly tremulous and with eyes that
swam in tears, that Jasper was for the moment
fairly taken in. There was uncommonly little
sentiment in his own composition, but such men
as he was, still like women to be softer-hearted
than themselves, and then Miss Willis looked
very pretty and delicate and helpless as she
glanced up at him from under the screen of her
dark eyelashes.</p>

<p>‘I can’t stand it, indeed I can’t, if you cry,
Miss Willis!’ he said, drawing a chair up to the
tiny work-table. ‘You have found me a sad bore
and a sad plague, I am afraid, since I was stupid
enough to do this at Pebworth races.’</p>

<p>As he spoke he looked down at his arm, which
still reposed in its silken sling, and assumed a
melancholy air, although in truth he felt all but
well again. Ruth, from beneath her eyelashes,
scanned him more narrowly than he was aware
of.</p>

<p>‘Is he amusing himself at my expense?’ thus
ran her quick thoughts. ‘Or has he been applying
thus early in the day to the cherry-brandy in
his hunting-flask, or the contents of the decanters?
No; he seems sober, and civil too. This is a
puzzle.’</p>

<p>Miss Willis was justified in her perplexity, for
this attention on Jasper’s part was something new.
The captain was not one of those men, of whom
there are no lack, who in a country-house flirt
to pass the time away, as naturally and with
as little ulterior design as they smoke a cigar
during their early stroll about the stables or the
Home Farm. He had accepted, as an Eastern
despot accepts the homage of his courtiers, fifty
petty kindnesses at Ruth’s hands during his
illness, and had preferred her company to that
of Lucy and Blanche simply because she was
cleverer than they, and had the tact not to weary
him.</p>

<p>‘I was sorry to see you so much in pain, Captain
Denzil, and glad when I could be of any use,’
answered Ruth, plying her needle with that
demure industry which can be intermitted or
resumed with such skilful effect in the course
of a conversation.</p>

<p>‘Yes; and I was bear enough never to thank
you, Miss Ruth. May I call you Ruth?’ said
Jasper, as he bent forward and took the girl’s
slender little hand in his. It was the first time
that he had ever touched the hand of Miss Willis,
save in the ceremonial salute with which members
of a household meet for the day or part for the
night.</p>

<p>‘I like to be called Ruth by my friends,’
returned the baronet’s ward. ‘Dear Blanche and
Lucy always call me by my Christian name, and
that pleases me, for I think it proves that they do
not any longer regard me as a stranger. And that
is much to me.’</p>

<p>There was a sweet simplicity, a touching pathos
in Ruth’s tone not wholly thrown away on Jasper.
He could not quite distinguish whether or not she
were playing a part; but if this were acting, he
owned that it was, of its kind, excellent.</p>

<p>‘I hope you count me among your friends?’ he
said, still keeping captive the little hand that he
held.</p>

<p>‘I shall be very pleased to do so,’ returned
Ruth, with a downward droop of her silken eyelashes.</p>

<p>‘I wish I did know how to please you. It’s
a lesson I should like to learn,’ said the captain,
with a warmth that surprised himself; but before
Miss Willis could return an appropriate answer,
the door opened so quickly that she had barely
time to snatch away her hand from Jasper’s
grasp before his two sisters were in the room.
Blanche Denzil had an open note in her hand,
and both girls wore an expression more animated
than usual. Lucy was the first to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>{277}</span></p>

<p>‘We want you, Jasper, to drive up with us to
High Tor, if you feel strong enough this morning.
Maud has written to Blanche, as she promised,
you know, to let us know when her silver
pheasants arrived from the dealer’s in London; and
this note’—and Lucy indicated the letter in her
sister’s hand—‘has just come, begging us to go
round and see the birds made comfortable in their
new abode. The day is charming. You must
come with us, indeed.’</p>

<p>‘Pheasants before the First of October gives one
leave to shoot them, are not much in my line,’
said Jasper carelessly. ‘What are <i>your</i> plans for
this morning, Miss Willis?’</p>

<p>Ruth with becoming modesty replied that Captain
Denzil was only too good to inquire as to the
proceedings of so insignificant a person as she was.
‘I try to be useful,’ she said. ‘Sometimes Sir
Sykes allows me to read aloud to him the newspapers
or a book. If nobody wants me, I think
I shall stroll down to the quiet cool path in the
woods beside the river. It is a favourite haunt of
mine.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I’ll walk down there with you, if you
don’t mind my cigar, Miss Willis,’ replied the
captain languidly. ‘I don’t want particularly to
go to High Tor, or to go into ecstasies over the
fine feathers of a lot of fancy poultry cooped in a
pen and called pheasants.’</p>

<p>‘No, no,’ said Blanche and Lucy with one
accord; ‘we are not going to allow you to play
truant to-day. You must come, and so must Ruth.
We never thought of leaving her behind’ (this by-the-bye
was the whitest of white fibs, for up to
that moment Ruth’s companionship on the projected
expedition had never once crossed the mind
of either of the sisters); ‘and there is plenty of
room for all in the double basket-carriage.’</p>

<p>‘I shall be bored, and shew it. The De Veres
are not a bit in my line. Harrogate, for instance,
I can’t get on with for five minutes—my fault, I
daresay. But he knows nothing and cares nothing
about the things that interest me; and I trouble
my head just as little about his model cottages
and reclamation of waste lands and militia drill.
The one subject we have in common is fox-hunting,
and even on that we take somewhat different
views.’ This was a long speech for Jasper; but the
concession which it somewhat ungraciously implied
was readily accepted by his jubilant sisters.</p>

<p>‘You forget Lady Gladys,’ said Blanche archly;
‘she would never forgive us if we appeared without
you.’</p>

<p>The double basket-carriage, one of those convenient,
roomy, and perhaps to male eyes ugly
vehicles, that do so much good service in country
places, came round in due course, drawn by its
pair of strong and spirited Exmoor ponies, coblike,
sturdy little animals, well fitted to make light of
the steep Devonshire roads, yet shewing some of
the fire and fleetness due to their dash of Arab
blood. The ‘clothes-basket on wheels,’ as Jasper
irreverently styled it, received its human freight;
Miss Willis, in spite of Blanche’s instances, seating
herself meekly with her back to the horses, and
the captain of course beside her. Lucy took the
reins; the smart boy in livery who had been standing
at the ponies’ heads, let go the bridles and
sprang deftly to his perch behind as the light
carriage bowled merrily away along the smooth
park road.</p>

<p>Never yet, since first she made her appearance
at Carbery Chase, had Ruth looked one half so
attractive, in her quaint elfish way, as she did
then, as flashing and animated, her dark eyes
saying far more than did her lips, she conversed
with Jasper on the outward drive.</p>

<p>‘I declare,’ thought the captain to himself, ‘if
the governor had been a little more explicit, I
wouldn’t mind speaking out. With three thousand
a year, or four—ay, it would require to be four—the
thing might be managed.’</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="NOTHING_NEW">NOTHING NEW.</h2>
</div>


<p>‘<span class="smcap">There</span> is no new thing under the sun,’ says a
proverb which is itself perhaps only the rehabilitation
of some antediluvian precept to the same
effect; and nothing so powerfully argues in favour
of the truth of the statement as a little pamphlet
written by the eccentric though clever Marquis
of Worcester, and printed in London by J.
Grismond in 1663. It is entitled, ‘A Century of
the Names and Scantlings of such Inventions
as at present I can call to mind to have tried
and perfected, which, my former Notes being
lost, I have, at the instance of a powerful friend,
endeavoured now, in the year 1655, to set these
down in such a way as may sufficiently instruct
me to put any of them in Practice.’ Who the
‘powerful friend’ may have been it is impossible
to say. The published catalogue was, however,
dedicated to Charles II. by His Majesty’s ‘passionately
devoted, or otherwise disinterested, subject
and servant,’ the Marquis.</p>

<p>This dedication is followed by a quaintly worded
address to the two Houses of Parliament, craving
patronage for the author’s investigations, thanking
the Lords and Commons for past favours, ruefully
stating that the inventor had already spent ten
thousand pounds on his experiments, and promising
to prosecute his researches by the aid of one
Casper Kaltoff, who for five-and-thirty years had
been employed under him. The Marquis, in stating
his merits, is not too modest, for he belauds his
inventions and his disinterestedness to the skies,
and in well-chosen words suggests that if the
government refuse him its patronage, the government,
and not he, will suffer. Then, after the
custom of the age, he subscribes himself, ‘Your
most passionately bent fellow-subject in His
Majesty’s service, compatriot for the publick good
and advantage, and a most humble servant to all
and every of you,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Worcester</span>.’
</p>

<p>So far the Marquis is, comparatively speaking,
plain-spoken and straightforward; but when he
begins to catalogue his discoveries, the reader feels
bound to confess that though the noble peer may
have set down his notes in such a way as might
sufficiently instruct him to put any of them in
practice, he scarcely amplified them sufficiently to
instruct other people. Doubtless he was intentionally
vague in the specifications or explanations
of his inventions; for when he wrote, he still
cherished a hope that he would reap some substantial
fruits from his ingenuity; but in spite
of his vagueness, he wrote at least enough to
shew that many things even now regarded as new,
had been roughly thought out by his fertile
brain.</p>

<p>The specification first on the list is decidedly
mysterious. It is entitled ‘Seals abundantly significant,’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>{278}</span>
and professes to describe an invention
whereby accounts may be kept mechanically, and
a letter, ‘though written but in English, may be
read and understood in eight several languages,
and in English itself to a clean contrary and different
sense, unknown to any but the correspondent,
and not to be read or understood by him neither,
if opened before it arrive unto him.’ Presumably
this ambiguous statement alludes to an instrument
for writing accounts and letters in cipher, for the
four specifications that follow, treat of that hackneyed
subject, and one of them of a system of
short-hand which seems to be not without a modern
representative. Next comes a plan for telegraphing
by means of coloured flags and lights; and
then ‘A way how to level and shoot cannon by
night as well as by day and as directly.’ The
ninth specification is terribly pertinent to the
tragic event that happened at Bremerhafen in
December 1875. It speaks of ‘An engine, portable
in one’s pocket, which may be carried and fastened
on the inside of the greatest ship, and at any
appointed minute, though a week after, either of
day or night, it shall irrecoverably sink that ship.’
The note immediately following suggests torpedoes,
and relates to a plan for diving and fastening
a similar engine to a vessel.</p>

<p>Nor were Admiral Hobart Pacha’s attempts to
ward off the attacks of these submarine monsters
without a prototype; for the inventive Marquis
at once goes on to hint at a method whereby a
ship may be guarded from such a catastrophe
either by day or by night. Specification number
twelve is scarcely less suggestive of water-tight
compartments, for it alludes to ‘A way to make
a ship not possible to be sunk, though shot
an hundred times betwixt wind and water by
cannon.’ The next note does not seem to have
prompted the exertions of modern inventors; but
who shall say whether number fourteen is not
responsible for the employment of steam, or even
of hydraulic power, for the working of a vessel?
At all events, it hints at the economisation of
labour, and at the multiplication of force without
the intervention of a capstan or of similar machinery.
Number fifteen palpably suggests the
application of some motive-power very like steam
to boats. The Marquis speaks of ‘A way how to
make a boat work itself against wind and tide, yea,
both without the help of man or beast; yet so
that the wind or tide, though directly opposite,
shall force the ship or boat against itself.’</p>

<p>It is not surprising that, in the middle of the
seventeenth century, this, among many other
alleged inventions, was regarded as somewhat
chimerical; and indeed, at the present moment,
if we except steam, it is hard to believe that the
noble lord was not solemnly joking with Charles
II. and the two Houses of Parliament. But a
subsequent specification, which we shall notice in
its due order, proves that the Marquis knew of the
power of steam, and had practically experimented
with it; and there are therefore some grounds
for thinking that, had he been properly subsidised
and assisted, the name of Worcester might have
been as intimately associated with the great modern
means of locomotion as are those of Watt and
Fulton. Unfortunately the Marquis was too much
in advance of his age, and thus his genius was
lost upon it.</p>

<p>A very common table ornament of the present
day is hinted at in number eighteen, which speaks
of ‘An artificial fountain to be turned like an
hour-glass by a child in the twinkling of an eye.’
And number nineteen plainly suggests the carriage-brake
as now applied by every coachbuilder.
The two succeeding notices relate to the use of
water as a motive-power. And number twenty-three
tells of a water-clock intended not only
to shew the time, but also the motions of the
heavenly bodies. Number twenty-four is a plan
for discharging bullets by means of a silent
spring, ‘admirable for fire-works and astonishing
of besieged cities.’ And number twenty-six
is a method for the more effectual employment
of the lever as a mechanical force. Then follows
a dark hint at the employment of pontoons
for the formation of military bridges over
broad rivers; and another specification, number
thirty, speaks of a system for enabling four pieces
of cannon ‘to discharge two hundred bullets each
hour’—a thing which, under the old system of
loading by manual power at the muzzle, would
have been quite impossible. This is followed
by a number of different plans for writing in
cipher, and for communicating by means of various
objects, such as knotted strings, fringes, bracelets,
gloves, &amp;c., and by the smell, taste, and touch.
Number forty-four is a way ‘To make a key of a
chamber-door which to your sight hath its wards
and rose-pipe but paper-thick, and yet at pleasure
in a minute of an hour shall become a perfect
pistol, capable to shoot through a breast-plate
commonly of carbine-proof, with prime, powder,
and firelock, undiscoverably in a stranger’s hand.’
Such a diabolical machine in the possession of
one of the many unscrupulous gentlemen of the
period, would indeed have been a murderous
weapon if used freely in the dimly lighted streets
of London. Scarcely less unpleasant must have
been the Venetian instrument for noiselessly discharging
a poisoned needle at an unsuspecting
enemy.</p>

<p>Next come specifications headed respectively
‘A most conceited tinder-box,’ ‘An artificial bird,’
and ‘An hour water-ball;’ the last of which speaks
of a ball of any metal, ‘which, thrown into a pool
or pail of water, shall presently rise from the
bottom, and constantly shew, by the superficies of
the water, the hour of the day or night, never
rising more out of the water than just to the
minute it sheweth of each quarter of the hour;
and, if by force kept under water, yet the time is
not yet lost, but recovered as soon as it is permitted
to rise to the superficies of the water.’
Number forty-eight is the description of an improved
staircase, and number forty-nine of ‘A
portable engine, in way of a tobacco tongs, whereby
a man may get over a wall, or get up again
being come down, finding the coast proving unsecure
unto him.’ Then there is ‘A pocket ladder,’
‘A rule of gradation’ useful for cipher-writing,
‘A mystical jangling of bells’ for the conveyance
of private intelligence, and three notices relating
to ‘water-scrues.’ Number fifty-six is entitled
‘An advantageous change of centers;’ and respecting
it the Marquis says: ‘A most incredible
thing if not seen, but tried before the late king of
blessed memory, in the Tower by my directions,
two extraordinary ambassadors accompanying His
Majesty, and the Dukes of Richmond and Hamilton,
with most of the court, attending him. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>{279}</span>
wheel was fourteen feet over, and forty weights
of fifty pounds apiece. Sir William Balfore, then
lieutenant of the Tower, can justify it with several
others. They all saw that no sooner these great
weights passed the diameter line of the lower side
but they hung a foot further from the center, nor
no sooner passed the diameter line of the upper
side but they hung a foot nearer. Be pleased to
judge the consequence.’ In this modest request
the Marquis appears to shroud a hint that he has
discovered the secret of perpetual motion, which,
however, has like all other perpetual-motion
schemes, failed in practice.</p>

<p>Specification number fifty-eight is certainly in
some measure responsible for the modern revolver,
telling as it does of a method ‘whereby a pistol
may be made to discharge a dozen times with one
loading, and without so much as once new priming
requisite, or to change it out of one hand into the
other, or stop one’s horse.’ And the next notices
are for the application of similar systems to
carabines, muskets, arquebusses, and crocks or
ship-muskets, and of a different method for sakers.
In these ideas we may recognise indeed the first
principles not only of the revolver, but also of the
Winchester rifle and of the mitrailleuse in its
various forms. Warfare has recently been revolutionised
by inventions of this kind; and the conditions
of naval warfare especially are now likely
to be altered by the arrangement which practically
places the whole broadside of a vessel under the
control of one man. For this latter improvement
we may find the idea in the Marquis’s plan by
which ‘one man in the cabbin may govern the
whole side of ship-muskets, to the number, if need
require, of two or three thousand shots.’ After
devoting several notices to the various aspects of
this subject, the noble inventor complacently remarks:
‘When first I gave my thoughts to make
guns shoot often, I thought there had been but
one only exquisite way inventible, yet by several
trials and much charge I have perfectly tried all
these.’ The necessary experiments appear to have
left him with an old cannon or two upon his
hands, as the next and most important specification
shews that the scientific nobleman nearly
succeeded in blowing himself up, and so concluding
his investigations. He calls it ‘A fire water-work;’
and probably that remarkable name
expresses, as well as any other might, the Marquis’s
‘admirable and most forcible way to drive up
water by fire, not by drawing or sucking it upwards,
for that must be as the philosopher calleth
it, <i>intra sphæram activitatis</i>, which is but at such
a distance. But,’ he emphatically continues, ‘this
way hath no bounder, if the vessels be strong
enough.’</p>

<p>Then he goes on to give us what seems to be
the earliest record of the employment of steam-power
in England. ‘I have taken,’ he says, ‘a
piece of a whole cannon, whereof the end was
burst, and filled it three-quarters full of water,
stopping and scruing up the broken end, as also
the touch-hole; and making a constant fire under
it, within twenty-four hours it burst and made a
great crack. So that having a way to make my
vessels, so that they are strengthened by the force
within them, and the one to fill after the other, I
have seen the water run like a constant fountain-stream
forty feet high; one vessel of water, rarefied
by fire, driveth up forty of cold water. And a
man that tends the work is but to turn two cocks;
that, one vessel of water being consumed, another
begins to force and re-fill with cold water, and so
successively, the fire being tended and kept constant,
which the self-same person may likewise
abundantly perform in the interim between the
necessity of turning the said cocks.’ Following
this are four notices relating to improvements for
locks to chests and safes, one relating to a drawbridge,
and one treating of what the Marquis calls
‘A conceited door’—namely one which will open
either inwards or outwards.</p>

<p>Two paragraphs further on comes the short
specification, ‘How to make a man to fly; which
I have tried with a little boy of ten years old in a
barn, from one end to the other, on a hay-mow.’
The last clause is certainly acceptable; for it
justifies a hope that the poor little fellow did not
break his neck in the pursuit of science. The
three succeeding notices are entitled respectively
‘A continually going watch,’ ‘A total locking of
cabinet-boxes,’ and ‘Light pistol barrels;’ and the
headings serve to demonstrate at least the versatility
of the author. Next come two methods for
carrying secret correspondence without observation,
an idea for the economisation of labour in rasping
hartshorn, and the specification of a calculating
machine. These are followed by notices of two
barbarous engines, respectively called ‘An untoothsome
pear’ and ‘An imprisoning chair,’ of a candle-moulding
machine, and of a talkative artificial
head, the <i>modus operandi</i> of which we take the
liberty of smiling at. The Marquis states that his
invention would answer in French, Latin, Welsh,
Irish, or English, any question put to it, and then
shut its mouth until the next question was asked.
It cannot be doubted that if the artificial head
were so life-like as to be able to answer questions,
it would also do a little talking on its own account.
The noble Lord seems at this period to have
been suffering from an attack of moral depravity;
for the incredible notice of the brazen head is
followed by two specifications of methods for
cheating at cards and dice respectively; and a
little lower down, we come upon ‘a little engine
portable in one’s pocket, which placed to any
door, without any noise but one crack, openeth
any door or gate.’ Number ninety-three is the
specification of an engine for raising sunken
ships; and at the end of the long catalogue are
some mysterious notices of a machine which the
Marquis modestly calls ‘a semi-omnipotent engine,’
and of two other machines which conjointly seem
to hint at some knowledge of hydraulic power
of which the discoverer was particularly proud.
‘I deem this invention,’ he says, ‘to crown my
labours, to reward my expenses, and make my
thoughts acquiesce in way of further inventions;’
and he concludes by hinting at leaving to
posterity a book wherein his inventions, ‘with the
shape and form of all things belonging to them,
should be printed by brass plates.’</p>

<p>And so we will take leave of the inventive
nobleman, who, though apparently not always too
veracious, was decidedly a genius. It is probably
owing to the fact of his having lived in an inappreciative
age that he is to this day usually placed on
a level with the fabulous Academicians of Laputa,
rather than among such men as Franklin, Arkwright,
and Watt; but on the other hand, it is
not unlikely that had his Century of Inventions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>{280}</span>
been judiciously reduced to a score, or even a
dozen, the Marquis of Worcester’s reputation
among his contemporaries might have stood proportionately
higher.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="AN_INSURANCE_TALE">AN INSURANCE TALE.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> a solicitor of considerable standing and
practice in a large provincial town in Ireland, the
name of which it is here unnecessary to mention.
On the evening of the 31st of December some
twenty-five years ago, I was in the aforesaid town
sitting in my study. The day had been one of
unusual inclemency; rain had alternated with sleet
and snow; and the cold and cutting wind had
blown with a rude strength which made its chilly
touch at once incisive. As the shades of night had
begun to fall, the storm, instead of abating, had
risen in turbulence and height; and at the hour
of which I am about to speak, the spasmodic
energy of the elements seemed like the last convulsions
of the dying year. I had been reading
some legal documents during the evening; but
perceiving from a glance at my watch that it was
fast approaching twelve o’clock, I laid my papers
aside and drew my chair nearer to the fire. The
hail beat violently against the windows, the wind
sighed amongst the trees outside, and the keyhole
of my study-door expressed its feelings in tones
if possible more melancholy.</p>

<p>The feeling of which I was conscious, as I sat
thus gazing into the blazing comfort before me,
was one of selfish satisfaction that I was not
at the mercy of the tempest outside. Forms of
various human sufferers presented themselves to
my mental vision, and seemed to take the shape
of the red coals in the fire; while the wind and
my sorrowing keyhole seemed vocal with the
burden of their woe. I was soon plunged in a
deep moralising on the misery which we see
around us—on that strange invisible link between
sorrow and sin; and the last moments of the passing
year were just landing me in one of those good
resolutions which we are told form such excellent
paving-stones, when I was aroused from my moral
reverie by a knock at my study-door. Pushing my
chair back a little distance from the fire, and
assuming a more professional air, I articulated the
well-known ‘Come in;’ and this mandate was
duly obeyed by my servant, who informed me
that a gentleman outside was particularly anxious
to see me.</p>

<p>A moment afterwards, a figure which in all but
size resembled our old friend the ‘drowned rat,’
entered my study, and making a courteous bow,
said: ‘I fear this is a very unreasonable hour
to intrude upon you, sir.’ My visitor was very
tall, had a pale thoughtful face, and when he
unbuttoned the coat which covered him from
head to foot, I perceived that he was a clergyman.</p>

<p>‘Won’t you take a seat by the fire?’ I said, ‘for
you must be very cold and wet such a night as
this.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you, sir,’ he replied; ‘I am too wet to
sit down. I had better tell you at once the cause
of this unseasonable visit. I have been attending
in my capacity as a Christian minister a young
lady who has been very ill, and is now, I believe,
dying. She sent for me to-night about ten o’clock,
and when I went to her, she entreated me to go
for a solicitor. I had heard of you, sir, as a man
of standing in that profession, and I have accordingly
come to ask you to drive over with me to
her.’</p>

<p>I suggested that the lady very probably wanted
to make her will, and wished for professional
assistance.</p>

<p>‘I cannot tell,’ he replied. ‘I asked her if no
one but a solicitor would do, and she said not.
She said she <i>must</i> see a solicitor before she died.
She seemed terribly distressed, and pressed her
request so earnestly upon me that I felt I dare
not neglect it.’</p>

<p>‘How far is the young lady’s residence from
this?’ I asked, wishing to bring the matter to a
practical issue.</p>

<p>‘About ten miles,’ replied the clergyman.</p>

<p>‘Ten miles on a night such as this is no joke!’</p>

<p>‘It is, sir, a long drive, and I know that the
night is very severe; but I would take it as a
great favour if you would come with me. I know
not where to go or what to do, if you decline. I
will drive you there, and send my car back with
you; and you will of course hold me responsible
for your fees.’</p>

<p>The last sentence decided my wavering resolve
and gained the clergyman’s object; for what
attorney ever remained inactive where he had a
good mark for costs? So shrugging my shoulders,
I said: ‘Well, I suppose I had better go with you,
though I should much prefer going to bed.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ he replied; ‘it is very good of you
to consent.’</p>

<p>Having provided myself with the writing
materials necessary to draft a will, and having
wrapped myself from head to foot in waterproof,
I accompanied the clergyman to the hall-door.
There we ascended the conveyance which was to
take us to our destination, and soon were cutting
our way through the driving sleet and snow.
Being of an inquisitive turn of mind, I thought
it would be wise to elicit from the clergyman some
little information about the young lady whose will I
supposed that I was about to draw; and with that
view I began to examine him. I, however, found
that he could tell me very little. He only knew
that she was a Miss M——; that she had been
staying with an aunt of hers who lived in his
parish; that she had become dangerously ill some
four or five days previously; that he believed she
was an only daughter; that her mother was dead;
and that her father had been telegraphed for, and
was expected to arrive in the morning. He added
earnestly: ‘He will never see his daughter alive,
poor man!’</p>

<p>While we were speaking, the joy-bells had begun
to ring out their merry peals, welcoming in the
new year. In a few moments, however, after the
clergyman’s last remark, they ceased, and a dead
silence ensued. ‘How ironical was the tone of
those bells!’ said the clergyman with a sigh, as the
last peal was dying away. I answered half-unconsciously
‘Yes;’ but I little knew how fully I
would comprehend his meaning before many
hours had passed away.</p>

<p>After a long and bitter drive, the conveyance
at last drew up at a large old-fashioned house, with
the appearance of which I was well acquainted,
and which I knew to be the residence of an old
lady of property, though I had never been inside
it. The clergyman, on alighting, brought me
round to a side-door, at which he knocked very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>{281}</span>
gently. After he had knocked two or three times,
the door was at length opened to us by an elderly
woman, whom I afterwards learned to be the
nurse, and who conducted us, by the aid of a lantern,
up an old winding-stair into a long corridor.
Stopping before a door at the end of it, the nurse
motioned us to wait while she entered the room.
She had been only a few seconds inside, when I
heard a low moan, and a female voice exclaim
almost in a cry: ‘Oh, has the time come?’ A
moment afterwards the clergyman and myself had
entered the room, and lying on a bed in the
middle of it I saw the form of a young girl apparently
about twenty-four or twenty-five years of
age. As we approached her bedside, the clergyman
said to her: ‘I have brought the solicitor
with me;’ but she did not answer him, and gently
waved her hand for the nurse and himself to
leave the room.</p>

<p>After they had left, she looked at me earnestly
for a minute and then said in a faint voice: ‘Are
you a solicitor, sir?’</p>

<p>I answered: ‘I am;’ and added: ‘I suppose you
wish me to draw your will for you?’</p>

<p>‘My will!’ she said with evident surprise. ‘Ah
no! I have nothing to leave, except perhaps my
heart.’ She remained for some time after this
without speaking, her silence being only broken
by moans such as I had heard from the corridor.
After a little while I heard her murmur: ‘O my
father, my poor dear father! must it be?’ then
clasping her two almost fleshless hands, she closed
her eyes for a few moments. At last, with evident
effort, she turned round on her pillow, and
looking straight at me, said in a voice tremulous
with weakness and emotion: ‘I want, sir, to make
a statement to you which I feel it my duty to
make before I die. It has tortured me for
months, and I dare not meet my Maker if I did
not tell all, though it breaks my very heart to
do so.’</p>

<p>Fearing that she was going to confess some
crime, or make some other important criminal
declaration, I said to her: ‘If you are about to
make any statement which may be of importance
afterwards, I had better go for a magistrate, and
you can make it before him.’</p>

<p>‘O no, sir; no magistrate!’ she cried out
earnestly. ‘What I have to tell concerns my poor
father, and I dare not state it to a magistrate, for it
might ruin him. If you will not hear me and try
to save my poor father, I shall die with sealed
lips. O my father! my good kind father! it is too,
too cruel that I must tell of your sin.’ The last
words were pronounced almost in a cry; the tears
filled her eyes, and she began to sob piteously.
Her racking cough soon followed; and I feared
that she must indeed die ‘with sealed lips,’ as she
had said; for to me it seemed that every succeeding
cough must be her last. After a little while,
however, a slight respite came, and she tried to
resume her statement. She gasped out: ‘The
insurance—the Blank Insurance’ (mentioning the
name of a well-known Company); ‘it’s not my’—— But
before she could get any farther, the cough
again seized her, and this time with such terrible
power that the poor creature fell back utterly
exhausted.</p>

<p>Fearing that her life was now really waning, I
went to the door of the room for the nurse, who at
once came in. When she had settled the sufferer
in a more easy position, she turned to me
and whispered: ‘Very little longer, sir!’ I, however,
remained in the room, in the hope that after
a little time she might have strength to resume
her statement; but when half an hour had nearly
elapsed without bringing with it any sign of returning
strength, I saw that the statement must
remain in its unfinished condition. I therefore
wrote down carefully all that had occurred, put
it into an envelope, sealed it, placed it in my
pocket, and prepared to go away. Before doing
so, I took one look at the form that lay on the
bed before me. To describe her face, I cannot,
though I seem to see it as distinctly to-day as I
saw it then—one of those strangely exquisite
flowers, whose tender growth so often kindles the
selfish craving of the old reaper, Death. I had
stood by many a death-bed; my profession had
inured me to scenes of anguish and pain; but
as I looked on that pale beautiful woman, and
read on her features the impression which told
only too plainly of a conflict of racking reality
within, my cold heart softened, and my whole
nature went forth in one great yearning to comfort
and to soothe her. I breathed a prayer for the soul
that was passing—earnest, as I had never known
earnestness before; and with feelings too sad to
portray, but too real to be forgotten, I left the
room and the house.</p>

<p>Two days after this eventful night, my friend
the clergyman (whom I subsequently discovered to
be the newly appointed rector of a neighbouring
parish) again entered my study. He told me that
the poor young girl was dead, that she had passed
away about half an hour after I had left the room,
never having spoken a word after that terrible fit
of coughing to which I had been a witness.</p>

<p>The question then came to be decided as to
the meaning of the broken statement made by
the young girl, and what was my duty with regard
to it. I have since frequently questioned the
wisdom and propriety of the course which I then
pursued; but whether right or wrong, my action
was the result of much deliberation. I wrote
in the first instance to the insurance Company,
asking them if they would kindly inform me, as
solicitor for the late Miss M——, whether any
insurance had been effected on her life with that
Company; and if so, when and by whom it was
effected, what was the amount of it, and to whom
it had become payable by the fall of Miss M——’s
life. I received a letter in reply from the secretary
of the Company, informing me that my young
friend had herself, about a year previously, effected
an insurance on her own life in two policies of
five thousand pounds each, and that if she had
not otherwise assigned the policies during her
lifetime, the sum of ten thousand pounds was
payable to her executors or administrators, as the
case might be.</p>

<p>The receipt of this information led me to believe,
what I had suspected before, that there was
something wrong about this insurance, though I
could not exactly determine the nature of that
something. I therefore wrote a second time to the
Company, stating that I had reason to believe that
it would be wise for the Company to make careful
inquiries with reference to the Policy, before surrendering
its value. The secretary at once wrote
back to me asking me to state the information
which led me to form this belief; but I replied that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>{282}</span>
I was not in possession of any information whatever
bearing on the matter, but that from what
took place at an interview which I had had with
the late Miss M—— a short time before her death,
I had been led to suspect that there was something
wrong about the insurance.</p>

<p>I heard no more of the matter till one morning
some two or three months afterwards, when I was
honoured with a visit from the secretary and
solicitor of the insurance Company. They told
me that the father of my poor young friend had
threatened them with legal proceedings if they
did not pay the amount of the insurance at once,
and asked me to tell them exactly what had
passed at the interview to which I had alluded
in my letter. At first I hesitated as to whether
I ought to do so or not, but ultimately I gave
them a true account of all that had taken place
on that fatal 31st of December. They thanked
me warmly, said they thought I had only done
my duty in disclosing the matter to them, and
went away.</p>

<p>What use the Company made of this information,
or what means they adopted to probe the
mystery to its source, I do not know; but
about six months after my interview with the
secretary and solicitor, when I was beginning
to hope that I should never hear of the case
again, I received a summons to attend at an
assizes to be shortly holden in the county town of
a northern shire. There was no means of refusing
this command, though I would have given
a good deal to be able to evade it. I therefore
found myself, about a fortnight after its
receipt, quietly sitting in the crowded court-house
of the aforesaid town, a witness in the case of
‘M—— <i>versus</i> The Blank Insurance Company.’</p>

<p>I had but little difficulty as I looked round the
court in identifying the plaintiff; for my eyes
soon rested on a manly form bearing an unmistakable
resemblance to the young girl by whose
death-bed I had stood about a year before. The
beauty of her face was there moulded in lines of
masculine firmness and power; and though her
father’s expression was far from pleasing, there
was nothing about him at all indicative of the
character subsequently exhibited to the court.
He appeared to be a gentleman of good birth
and position; and as I looked at him before
the case began, I was very curious to know what
was his real position with reference to the insurance,
and how far it would be disclosed on the
evidence.</p>

<p>His counsel, in opening the plaintiffs case, said
that it was one of the simplest cases ever ushered
into a court of justice. The facts, he said, were
simply these: ‘Two years previously, the late
Miss M—— insured her life with the defendants,
the Blank Insurance Company, in two policies of
five thousand pounds each. A year after, she had
effected these insurances, Miss M—— had died,
without having assigned or disposed of the policies
in any way. Her father, the plaintiff, was her
only next of kin and her administrator, and was
now entitled absolutely to the ten thousand pounds;
which the Company, however, had refused to pay.’
To an uninitiated spectator, the evidence for the
plaintiff certainly seemed to bear out the counsel’s
statement; but when the plaintiff’s case had
closed, the counsel on behalf of the Company
rose and said that they were in a position to prove
by a connected chain of evidence that every word
of the plaintiff’s case was valueless, and that this
insurance had been effected under circumstances
of the grossest fraud and crime.</p>

<p>I myself was the first witness called on behalf
of the Company; and after much objection, I was
allowed to give a plain unvarnished description of
the scene which I have already depicted on that
sad night. You could have heard a pin drop
while I was speaking, and the sensation which was
produced in court was manifest. I was of course
severely cross-examined; but as I had nothing to
conceal, my testimony was not shaken.</p>

<p>The next witness for the Company was an eminent
London physician, who stated that in the
beginning of March, two years previously, Mr
M—— had come to him in London, and had
brought with him a young lady, who he said was
his daughter, to have her examined by him. He
then made a careful examination of the young
lady, and found her to be in rapid consumption,
of which result he told Mr M——, and added at
the same time that she could not in his opinion
live for six months. The Company’s own doctor
was next called, and stated that at the end of the
same month of March, Mr M—— had come to him
in London, and told him that his daughter was
anxious to effect an insurance on her life with the
Blank Company, and asked him to appoint a day
to examine her. He had known Mr M—— for
many years, but had never seen his daughter. Mr
M——, however, told him that she was a healthy
country girl, and he would have no difficulty in
passing her for the Company. It was then agreed
that he should call upon Mr M—— the next day at
the hotel at which they were staying and examine
his daughter. He did so; and Mr M—— then
introduced to him as his daughter a handsome
healthy-looking girl, with all the appearance of
having lived in the country. The girl looked so
very healthy, that he did not think it necessary to
make any minute examination of her, and merely
questioned her as to what diseases—if any—she
had had. She seemed very much confused, but this
he attributed to her natural shyness. He recommended
the Company to insure her life at the
ordinary rate for her age, which was then twenty-four.
The doctor was then told to look round the
court and say if he saw any one like the young
girl whom on that occasion he had examined; and
after a little while he pointed to a young girl, and
said that he believed that she was the person
whom he had then examined.</p>

<p>The excitement in court at this announcement
can scarcely be imagined. Every eye was turned
on the young girl, who a few minutes afterwards
ascended the witness-table. As I gazed at her, I
was painfully reminded of the poor creature whom
I had seen lying in such trouble less than a year
before; for the likeness to her was strangely great.
There was, however, a robustness, a glow of health
about the girl whom I now saw for the first time,
which was sadly wanting in my young friend, and
which served to conceal a resemblance otherwise
manifest. She said that she lived in the south of
England with her father, who was a well-to-do
farmer. Two years and a half previously, Mr
M—— and his daughter had come to lodge at their
farm for the benefit of Miss M——’s health, as she
was then very delicate. Every one noticed a very
strong likeness between herself and Miss M——,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>{283}</span>
and a firm friendship arose between them. Mr
and Miss M—— stayed about six months at the
farm; and when they were about to go away to
London, Mr M—— proposed that she should go
up with them as a companion to his daughter,
which she did. On the day before they left
London, Miss M—— went out with her father
to pay a visit, and she was left by herself in the
hotel. She was sitting alone in their private room
reading, when suddenly Mr M—— returned alone,
rushed into the room, and said in a threatening
manner: ‘You must say you are my daughter!
There is a gentleman coming in now; and mind you
<i>must</i> say you are my daughter! If you don’t, we’ll
all be ruined. Remember!’ He then hastened
back, and in less than a minute re-entered with
the Company’s doctor, the last witness. She was
so completely taken by surprise and overcome
with alarm, that she did not know what she was
doing, but nevertheless felt completely under the
influence of Mr M——. He introduced her to the
doctor as his daughter; the doctor shook hands
with her, and said he was glad to see her looking
so strong and well. He asked her whether she
had lived much in the country; and said he
thought it would be a mere farce to go through
the form of examining any one who looked so
completely the essence of health as she did. He
mentioned a great number of diseases, and asked
her if she ever had had any of them; and after
some other remarks he concluded with: ‘Well, I
think I may now tell them that you’re not going
to die yet awhile.’ He then talked a little to
Mr M——; they had wine together; he bade
adieu to her, and the two gentlemen quitted
the house. All was mystery to her. She now
began to entertain a confused sort of dread of Mr
M——. When his daughter came home, she told
her all about it, and asked her what it meant;
but Miss M—— said that she did not know—that
perhaps it was a joke of her father’s. She, however,
forced Miss M—— to promise never to say
anything about it.</p>

<p>What the effect of this evidence was on the
occupants of the court, I can hardly say, for I was
too much absorbed in my own thoughts to notice
any manifestation of feeling in others. The truth
was now only too plain. The father of my young
friend, knowing that his daughter’s health was failing,
had resolved to profit by her death, and with
that intent had secured a simple country girl and
brought her up to London, to be the unwitting
means of accomplishing his unfeeling design. In
London he had learned on the best authority that
his daughter could not live for six months, and
within a month afterwards he had insured her life
in her own name, without her knowledge, for a
large sum of money, which he knew must be paid
to him on her death; and to secure the lucre for
which he craved, he had passed off for his poor
dying daughter a healthy country girl; he had
lied to his old friend, and caused an innocent girl
to perpetrate a fraud. As these facts came home
to my mind in their horrid reality, I gazed across
the court to see the man who had conceived this
mighty inhumanity. The coil of truth, as it had
been gradually unravelled by the witnesses, seemed
to have wound itself serpent-like round the frame
of its foe; for the form which a little while before
had been erect and defiant was now humbly prone,
the eye which had glanced restlessly round the
court was now fixed on the ground, and a death-like
pallor lay on his countenance.</p>

<p>The jury without leaving their box pronounced
their verdict for the Company, and the judge thereupon
solemnly announced that he would direct a
criminal prosecution to be instituted against the
plaintiff for the crimes disclosed in that most painful
case. At this announcement, I rose and
entreated the judge not to adopt that course. I
reminded him of the dying anxiety of the poor
daughter to have her father saved, and urged that
the plaintiff would be sufficiently punished by the
loss of position which must be consequent on the
verdict. But my solicitations were all in vain.
The judge said that he sat there to protect society,
and that if such crimes as had been that day disclosed
were allowed to pass unpunished, he would
fail in the duty which he sat there to discharge.
A few minutes afterwards Mr M—— left the court
in custody; and as I saw him thus committed to
the pitiless mercy of the law, compassion—which
can look on the wicked as well as the good—seemed
to rise within me, and I almost regretted
that I had put the insurance Company on the
track which they had followed with such fatal
accuracy.</p>

<p>The law, however, though very powerful, is not
omnipotent; and in this case its power was destined
to be futile. It was found not to be convenient
to try Mr M—— at the same assizes; and
his trial was therefore postponed till the following
one, and he himself allowed out on bail. The next
assizes came round, and everything was ready for
the trial; but the prisoner was nowhere to be
found. They called him in the court, they called
him outside; but in vain. It was soon found that
the prisoner had absconded—vanished no one knew
where; and the individuals who had been kind
enough to stake a portion of their worldly goods
on his reappearance, were asked to shew their
affection for him by paying the penalty which the
law so properly attaches to such misplaced philanthropy.
The following comment on the case
appeared a day or two afterwards in the local
newspaper: ‘We can only say that justice has
been defeated, and a very bad type of criminal
has escaped unpunished. The inscrutable wisdom
of Providence has reserved his punishment for
another world.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>More than twenty years after the events above
narrated, the course of my professional business led
me to cross the Atlantic and visit the city of New
York. It happened in the course of that visit, as
I was returning to my hotel at a late hour one
night, that I became conscious that a human form
was following me. I at once looked round, and
saw within a yard of me an old man with a long
white beard and weather-beaten face, dressed in
ragged attire, shoeless and stockingless. Something
in his face caught my attention, and on looking
at it more closely, I recognised it as one which
I had seen before, though I could not then tell
where. When I turned round, the old man
muttered in an earnest, almost savage manner:
‘Give me some money; I want it badly—very
badly;’ but as I did not feel quite easy at finding
so questionable a creature so close to me at such an
hour of the night and in a strange city, I made
no reply to his request, but hastened my steps.
He, however, followed me, and again craved for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>{284}</span>
money; and this time I answered in our English
stereotyped form: ‘I have nothing for you, my
good man.’</p>

<p>I suppose, however, that he did not catch my
reply, for he added sharply: ‘What do you say?’
To which I answered: ‘I say that I have no money
for you.’</p>

<p>‘Do you indeed?’ he said with fury. ‘Then
keep it, and perish with it. I hope it may drag
you down, as it did me.’ With these words he
turned away, and I heard his steps behind me
no more; but I had not gone very far when I
recollected on what former occasion I had seen
the old man’s face. I remembered that it was
the same face which twenty years before I had
seen in that northern court-house—the face that
had known a death-like pallor when the heavy
chain of Truth clanked forth its tale of hidden
guilt. I at once stopped and turned round; but
I could only distinguish faintly the outline of
his figure in the distance; and as I gazed at
that ragged form, retreating I knew not whither,
there flashed with vivid reality through my mind
the events which I have endeavoured here to
relate, and I remembered the words of a thoughtful
modern writer: ‘The secrets of men’s lives
are rarely held inviolate till eternity—there is a
reckoning here without the aid of eternal books.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_PRAIRIES_AND_THEIR">THE PRAIRIES AND THEIR
INHABITANTS.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> subject of sport has a fascinating interest for
readers of almost every class. Nor is this interest
lessened when the scene of such adventures is laid
in the wide prairies of the Far West. On those
vast plains, ocean-like in their rolling expanse, the
wigwam of the red man, and the bison and other
denizens of the prairie, are alike disappearing, to
be succeeded by the stately and magnificent cities
which are the result of American enterprise and
civilisation. Lieutenant-colonel Dodge, an officer
in the United States army, gives us, in his <i>Hunting
Grounds of the Great West</i> (London: Chatto
and Windus, 1877), an instructive résumé of the
present aspect and position of those plains, which
are still in great measure a Debatable Land, on
the frontiers of which a fierce warfare is almost
constantly being carried on between the wandering
Indian tribes and the white settlers who are
every year supplanting them.</p>

<p>The distinctive term ‘The Plains’ is specially
applied to the area of rolling prairies extending
from the mountains of Texas on the south to the
British line on the north, and from the Missouri
river on the east to the Rocky Mountains on the
west.</p>

<p>Although called Plains they are never absolutely
level, but present many undulations and much
variety of surface. Even in their most barren
stretches they are covered with short grass, but
are almost without trees, which grow only in the
cañons or deep water-courses. On the higher
Plains this absence of trees is caused by want of
water and the prevalence of high winds; and on
the lower, by the prairie-fires kindled by the
Indians, by the devastation caused by beavers, and
by the prevalence, although in a lesser degree, of
wind. In winter, on these wide Plains the storms
are sometimes fearful; the icy cold north wind
curdles the blood in the veins, and is speedily
fatal to any living creature that is exposed to its
fury; even birds fall dead in great numbers. Its
destructiveness is only equalled by the terrific
rain, thunder, and hail-storms which occur in
summer.</p>

<p>No one should ever travel over the Plains without
a compass, although in the unsettling misery
of feeling lost, confidence is sometimes lost even in
that friendly guide. In winter, from the glare of
the sun on the wide waste of snow, a painful
affection called snow-blindness is experienced by
most travellers on the Plains. Not only is the
power of vision temporarily lost, but if the skin be
at all sensitive, the face and hands swell and
blister, and are as exquisitely painful as if scorched
by fire. In travelling, the choice of a camping-place
is of the first importance; water, grass,
and wood are essential requisites, and so is a
knowledge of the special dangers which beset
wanderers on these prairies. Camp-life, Colonel
Dodge tells us, with a good tent, a nice mess-kit,
plenty of bedding, a travelling kitchen, and
supplies of preserved fruit and vegetables, is very
enjoyable indeed. The rifle rarely fails to provide
a good dinner, to which the hunters return at
sunset with a keen appetite, which enables them
to do full justice to the dainties of the prairie.
These discussed, they collect in the cool breezy
evening around the camp-fire, and with pipe and
flask and song and story, the short twilight hours
go merrily by.</p>

<p>One of the most frequent dangers to which camp-life
is exposed is prairie-fire, which rises and
spreads on all sides, to the height sometimes
of thirty feet, half-stifling the men with smoke
and heat, and driving the animals frantic with
terror. Another danger arises from the sudden
and severe rain-storms, which are so excessive
that they may be aptly denominated water-spouts.
Fancy a party of hunters in their comfortable
well-appointed camp, pitched as camps often are,
on the bank of a half-dry stream. After a luxurious
dinner and pleasant social evening, each has
retired to his own special tent, when suddenly the
unmistakable rush and roar of a large volume
of water awakens the traveller. In a moment he
is upon his feet, rushing out into the darkness to
discover if possible what it all means. The green
sward of the night before is gone—water is before,
behind, around him, everywhere!</p>

<p>When morning breaks, cold and gray, it shews,
instead of the picturesque river-bluff and comfortable
camp, an apparently shoreless lake, with
one or two cotton-wood trees gallantly stemming
the flood, on the topmost boughs of which are a few
forlorn specimens of humanity, cowering before the
keen wind, which as it careers along the prairie,
makes sad havoc of the few fluttering remnants
of their sleeping apparel. Fortunately, however,
these deluges are of short continuance, and abate
as quickly as they rise. Another danger, the possibilities
of which are diminishing every year, arises
from the stampedes to which the herds of buffalo
are periodically subject. When this sudden panic
seizes these immense brutes, they rush blindly
on after the leaders, trampling over everything
that comes in their way. Our author was camping
out one night in the spring of 1871 with four
wagons and a small escort. He had gone to bed,
but was not asleep, when he fancied that he heard
a faint, rushing sound; and suspicious that it might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>{285}</span>
be a water-spout, he sprang out of his tent, and
peered up the creek beside which the camp was
pitched. He strained his eyes in the darkness to
discover the line of foam, which is generally the
precursor of an approaching deluge; but to his
surprise he could discover nothing; yet the sound
went on increasing, and came evidently from the
prairie. Suddenly its probable cause flashed upon
him, and arousing his men, he explained to them
what he feared and besought them to keep calm.
This was somewhat difficult, for the buffalo were
already in sight, and to all appearance bearing
right down upon them. ‘Our only chance,’ he
said, ‘is to try to split the herd; if we cannot do
that, we are lost!’ With that end in view he
stationed his men fifty yards from the camp, and
in trembling and fear awaited the onslaught. On,
with a heavy trampling thud like thunder, rushed
the unwieldy mass till they were within thirty
yards of the men, who discharged their muskets
and yelled with the energy of despair. A few of
the foremost buffalo fell dead; the others wavered,
swerved a little, and finally plunged away on one
side, roaring and crashing and tumbling in the
darkness over the banks of the creek.</p>

<p>Another danger of camp-life proceeds from
rattlesnakes and vipers, which are very susceptible
of cold, and at night crawl close to the person of
the sleeper for warmth. One officer—a friend of
Colonel Dodge’s—once found a rattlesnake coiled
up beneath his pillow; and another, when drawing
on his boot, felt his foot come in contact with
a soft substance; he dropped the boot at once,
and a huge rattlesnake glided out. Another
nocturnal visitor almost as much dreaded as the
snakes is the skunk, a horrible little animal about
the size of a cat, which makes its way into a camp
and has been known to devour the face, hands,
or any uncovered part of the nearest sleeper; a
skunk-bite being almost invariably followed in
certain portions of the Plains by hydrophobia.</p>

<p>The great attraction of the Plains to sportsmen
is the variety and abundance of game which they
contain. First in order, as being pre-eminently
an habitué of the Plains, is the buffalo, or more
properly speaking, the bison, and which, in spite
of its apparent ferocity, is, according to Colonel
Dodge, who knows its habits well, a mild, stupid,
inoffensive animal.</p>

<p>The elk, although disappearing even faster
than the buffalo, is still to be met with on the
Plains; and his great size, magnificent antlers, and
splendid form, stamp him as the monarch of the
prairies. He is timid, and seldom even in the
last extremity employs his great strength in his
own defence; what he trusts to is his skill in
doubling, dodging, and hiding, which in spite of
his size he accomplishes as cunningly and successfully
as a hare or a fox. Many varieties of
the Deer tribe are found in the Plains; of these
the black-tailed deer, the red-deer, and the antelope
are the most abundant, affording in the
proper season boundless supplies of the most delicious
venison. The mountain-sheep can scarcely
be called an inhabitant of the Plains; his chosen
home being amid the wild crags and rugged
fastnesses of mountain-ranges. He is a fine animal,
with a body somewhat resembling that of a
deer, and a sheep’s head surmounted by a pair of
stupendous horns. His flesh is declared by the
gourmands of the hunting fraternity to be the
choicest of choice morsels, a delicious compound
of venison and the finest Southdown mutton.</p>

<p>The prairies abound with smaller animals,
rabbits of two kinds, gophers, and prairie-dogs a
species of marmot. The carnivora of the Plains are
not numerous. First come the wolves, which hunt
in packs, but whose power of making themselves
disagreeable has, Colonel Dodge thinks, been
greatly over-rated. This can scarcely be said of
the grisly bear, which is a huge, sagacious, and
pre-eminently ferocious brute. The cougar or
puma, which is sometimes called the Mexican
lion, is also a formidable antagonist to come
to close grips with. The panther is very much
the same animal on a smaller scale, and is
scarcely more dangerous than the wild-cat,
which is abundant and of a large size. A
variety of birds are found on the Plains, flocks
of quails, partridges, geese, and five species of
grouse; but none of these can compete in point of
size or delicacy with the wild turkey. This magnificent
bird when fat is often found to weigh
from twenty to twenty-five pounds.</p>

<p>Of the red men, the fast diminishing aborigines
of the prairies, Colonel Dodge does not draw a
very favourable picture. He paints them, he tells
us, as he finds them, not with every attribute
softened and toned down by the veil of false
sentiment which the romances of Cooper and other
novelists have thrown around them. The North
American Indian taken as he stands is as cruel,
lazy, and degraded a savage as is to be found
upon the face of the earth. Virtue, morality,
generosity, and honour are not only words without
a meaning for him, but have no synonyms
in his language. The bad qualities of the Indians
are, however, no good reason for the infamous
manner in which they have been treated by the
agents of the American government.</p>

<p>Intensely conscious of his own helplessness, and
conceiving that he is tossed about like a feather
between the good and bad god, it is very important
for the Indian to discover which of his deities
is in the ascendant for the moment; and this he
tries to do by divination. There is nothing so
trifling but that he may deduce from it a knowledge
of the supernatural; the flight of a bird, the
bark of a dog, the gliding of a snake through the
grass, are all full for him of a subtle intelligence;
but what he principally relies upon for information
is what he calls the making of a medicine. This
species of manufacture, the mysteries of which are
known only to himself, is undertaken upon all
occasions; and besides these private acts of what
may be called devotion, the tribe has from time
to time a great medicine-making in common, presided
over by a medicine chief. A huge structure
of dressed skins called a medicine lodge is set up,
with a rude image cut from a log suspended from
the roof. A certain number of warriors are then
selected from the assembled tribe, and a dance,
which may truly be called ‘the dance of death,’ is
begun. Day sinks into night and night dawns
into day, and still it goes on without a moment’s
intermission, till all the performers have fallen
senseless to the floor, some to rise no more. If
at the end of two or three days this strange
ceremony is concluded without a death, the medicine
chief pronounces it good medicine, and the
tribe separate assured of the protection of the
good god.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>{286}</span></p>

<p>As soon as an Indian boy becomes a warrior he
thinks of a wife; and as an Indian belle is often
something of a coquette, he finds, as others have
done, that the favours of wooing are ‘fashious to
seek.’ At length, however, the dusky beauty is
won, and the favoured lover betakes himself to the
father’s lodge, and something like the following
colloquy ensues. ‘You have got a daughter,’
begins the lover, ‘an ugly lazy thing; but I want
a wife, and I am willing as a favour to take her off
your hands.’</p>

<p>‘Are you speaking of my darling girl?’ says the
father—‘the prettiest best girl in the whole tribe.
I do not think of giving her to any one, much less
to you. Why, you are a mere boy; you have done
nothing to speak of; you have not taken one scalp;
you have only stolen a few wretched ponies. No,
no; she is not for you, unless indeed you give
me twenty ponies for her.’</p>

<p>‘Twenty ponies!’ yells the lover. ‘One is too
many.’ And thus the haggling goes on, until a
bargain is struck at something like the fair market-price
of the girl, who forthwith, for there is no
marriage ceremony, accompanies her new husband
or master to his father’s lodge. Many families
generally live under one roof, and they have not
upon an average more than one meal a day. A
large pot full of meat is set upon the fire, and when
sufficiently cooked is taken off and placed in the
middle of the floor. The inmates then gather
around and help themselves with their fingers.
What is left is set aside, and any one who feels
hungry goes and helps himself. The lodge of the
Indians is made of dressed buffalo-skins, supported
upon a light framework of wood. The fire is in the
centre; and as the draught is very defective, the
lodge is generally in cold weather full of smoke.
The beds are piles of buffalo-robes and blankets,
which serve as seats during the day. Furniture
there is none; except a few pots, kettles, and trunks
containing the dried meat and superfluous clothing
of the family, may be dignified by that term. But
what is wanting in upholstery is made up in dirt,
everything being kept in a state of inconceivable
filth. The wealth of an Indian consists in his
horses and mules; and as he leads a nomadic life
in fine weather, he rarely burdens himself with
anything that is not easily transported. In the
general division of meat and skins, the widows and
orphans of the tribe are cared for, and a certain
portion set aside for their maintenance.</p>

<p>The Indians are very fond of gambling, and
also of drinking, which is a very destructive vice
to them. Another of their favourite indoor amusements
is story-telling, in which they take great
delight. A good story-teller is a very important
personage in the tribe, and is always surrounded
by an eager audience.</p>

<p>The cruelty of the Indians is extreme; men and
women alike take an exquisite pleasure in torturing
their captives. Much of this cruelty, however,
has in latter days arisen from vengeful hatred to
the United States government, which has broken
faith with them over and over again, and is still
conducting a war of extermination. No wonder
that under the circumstances the red man should
resent the cruelties practised by his invaders,
and make reprisals when opportunity offers. It
is but fair to the Indians to state, that across
the frontier-line in Canada, where the treaties
made with them have been rigidly observed, there
have been no Indian wars and no Indian massacres;
and that the red men have proved themselves
to be quiet and not unthriving subjects of
Queen Victoria.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="ROBBERY_OF_AN_EXPRESS_TRAIN">ROBBERY OF AN EXPRESS TRAIN.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following story shews the extent to which
wholesale plunder may be carried on in the
United States of America: About eleven o’clock
on the night of Wednesday 19th September,
1877, an express train on the Union Pacific
Railway was approaching the little station of Big
Springs in Wyoming Territory. There wanted
fully a quarter of an hour to the time when it was
due, and the station-master William Barnard and
his assistant had not yet commenced to prepare for
its arrival; the former was still in his office, the
latter engaged somewhere about the premises. All
was as silent as a station generally is during the
intervals between trains; when the stillness was
suddenly broken in a manner no less unexpected
than unpleasant. The door of the office was burst
open, and four men entering, seized the astonished
station-master, and told him that if he attempted
the slightest resistance or refused to obey their
orders, his life should instantly be forfeited. He
had no choice but to submit; for he perceived
clearly by the words and actions of the intruders
that they were members of a large party of robbers,
and that the station was completely in their power.
They all wore crape masks to conceal their features,
but spoke in their natural tones; and as the band
consisted of thirteen men fully armed, nothing
but compliance with their demands was possible
on the part of the station officials. The place was
solitary, the hour late; and the robbers lost no
time in carrying out their evidently carefully prepared
plans. The telegraph apparatus was their
first object, and this they compelled the station-master
to destroy. Barnard endeavoured to mislead
them by only removing a portion of it, but
it was of no avail; one of the men angrily desired
him to mind what he was about or he would have
a bullet through his head, and then ordered him
to take out certain parts of the instrument and give
them to him; shewing by his knowledge of the
terms employed that he must have been a telegraph
operator himself. In the meantime the rest of the
band had not been idle. They compelled the
porter to put out his ordinary signals for the now
rapidly advancing train; and they maintained the
strictest watch to see that nothing was done that
might in the faintest degree create alarm or
suspicion.</p>

<p>All fell out exactly as they had anticipated:
the train came gradually to a stand in obedience
to the signal, and ran blindly into the trap prepared
for it. The unconscious passengers, most of
whom were asleep, were quite at the mercy of the
robbers, who lost not a moment in diligently
setting to work to make the most of the golden
opportunity before them. The train in the meantime
had drawn up at the platform; it was a long
one, consisting of a saloon and two Pullman’s
sleeping-cars, besides ordinary carriages and luggage-vans;
and there were a good many passengers,
nearly all of them sleeping soundly. A portion
of the gang at once made prisoners of the engineer
and stoker; while four of them compelled Barnard
the station-master to go as he usually did to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>{287}</span>
mail-van and knock at the door for admittance.
George Miller, the post-office agent in charge of
the mails and specie, immediately opened the
door, when several of the robbers jumped in, one
of them holding a revolver to his head, while the
others rapidly cleared the drawers and boxes of
all the money they contained; thus securing a
very large sum—about forty or fifty thousand
dollars. They did not trouble themselves to
examine the letters; and a combination-safe containing
a very large sum in gold and notes was
also left untouched; for it was beyond their power
to break it open, and neither Miller the agent nor
Patterson the conductor of the train knew the
combined intricacies; this the robbers obliged
them to swear on their word of honour.</p>

<p>The gang then directed their attention to the
passengers, most of whom were now awake, and
beginning to be aware of the unpleasant circumstances
in which they were placed. Some were
inclined to resist the highwaymen; but the more
prudent among them counselled submission, as
very few of them had available firearms, and
they were ignorant of the strength of the band,
and feared more serious consequences if they were
driven to resort to extremes. Of the likelihood of
this they had an early intimation; for a passenger
who chanced to be standing on the outside platform
of one of the carriages as the train entered
the station, had a couple of pistol-shots fired at
him, luckily without doing him any injury. He
retreated into the carriage, and was directly
followed by the robbers, who entered the car at
both ends, and desired the passengers to hold up
their hands; a command they all instantly obeyed.
They were then rifled one after the other; their
pockets being thoroughly searched, watches, purses,
and all loose money being taken away. This was
done in all the open carriages; but the doors of
the two Pullman sleeping-cars being locked, they
did not obtain an entrance into either; and the
inmates probably thinking discretion the better
part of valour, remained ensconced within their
shelter. Whether it would long have served as
such cannot now be determined; possibly the
robbers might have forced the doors had time been
allowed them; but fortunately for the travellers
the whistle of an approaching goods-train scared
the gang, who made a precipitate retreat from the
scene of their depredations, carrying their booty
along with them.</p>

<p>Relieved of their unwelcome presence, the passengers
issued forth from the cars and began to
relate their various experiences. Luckily no one
was seriously wounded. The postal agent had been
violently knocked against the carriage-door at the
first rush of the thieves, and was considerably
bruised, and another man had his forehead grazed
by a pistol bullet; but beyond those comparatively
trifling injuries they all escaped with the fright and
the loss of every article of value on which the
robbers had time to lay their hands. Most of the
passengers in the open cars were cleared of whatever
money they had about them, and several of
them lost gold and silver watches; but even in the
excitement of the moment a few of them had
sufficient presence of mind to enable them hastily
to secrete purses and pocket-books, either by
slipping them under the cushions or dropping
them on the floor. A Jew named Harris was
robbed of four hundred and fifty dollars and his
watch; but while raising his hands in obedience
to the command of ‘Hands up!’ he skilfully contrived
to drop a roll of notes on the seat beside
him, which was overlooked by the robbers as they
examined his pockets. A miner who wore a belt
containing eleven thousand dollars in gold, was
quick enough to fasten it round the waist of his
little child, who was not molested by the thieves,
and this large sum fortunately escaped their
clutches. They managed, however, in the short
space of time at their disposal to make some very
pretty pickings out of the train; their gains being
computed at fully fifty thousand dollars, besides
watches and other articles of value.</p>

<p>The scheme had evidently been a most carefully
organised one, and was carried out in every detail
with perfect coolness and regularity, not a moment
being wasted, and the members of the gang having
clearly been previously instructed as to the duty
each man was to perform. It is supposed they had
fastened their horses somewhere at the back of the
station, as on quitting the train they immediately
disappeared without leaving any traces behind
them.</p>

<p>An alarm was at once given, and several parties
started in pursuit; but their search was entirely
unsuccessful so far as regarded hearing any tidings
of the robbers. The following day a band of
searchers found among the mountains ten or twelve
miles from the station of Big Springs, a rifle, a
pistol, and an empty money-box; proving indisputably
that the highwaymen had passed that way.
It was well known that some very notorious
Missouri bandits were at large among the Black
Hills, and it is believed that they were the perpetrators
of the attack on the train. A large
reward was offered for their apprehension; but so
far as we know, they have hitherto managed to
elude all pursuit, and it is doubtful whether they
may ever be brought to justice. With such
possible contingencies, travelling by the Union
Pacific, or any other railway in the Far West, is
not a pleasant idea to contemplate.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="POPULAR_ERRORS_REGARDING_THE">POPULAR ERRORS REGARDING THE
SHREW-MOUSE.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">No</span> popular error is more absolutely destitute of
foundation than that regarding the shrew. This
little quadruped, very common in meadows and
pastures in all parts of Britain, and generally
known as the shrew-mouse, is as harmless as any
creature that lives. Its food consists of insects
and their larvæ; and its teeth are very small, so
that it is scarcely able to bite through the human
skin. Yet according to a popular belief, very
widely prevalent, its bite is most venomous, and
in many districts in England the viper is less
feared. Nor is it only its bite that is supposed
to be deadly to man or beast. Contact with
it in any way is accounted extremely dangerous;
and cattle seized with any malady, especially
if shewing any appearance of numbness in the
legs, are apt to be reputed ‘shrew-struck.’ Horses
in particular are accounted very liable to suffer
from this cause. An infallible cure, however,
was to be found in dragging the shrew-struck
animal through a bramble rooted at both ends, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>{288}</span>
in the application of a twig of a shrew-ash. ‘A
shrew-ash,’ says White, in his <i>Natural History of
Selborne</i>, ‘is an ash whose twigs or branches, when
gently applied to the limbs of cattle, will immediately
relieve the pain which a beast suffers from
the running of a shrew-mouse over the part
affected; for it is supposed that a shrew-mouse is
of so baneful and deleterious a nature, that whenever
it creeps over a beast, whether it be horse,
cow, or sheep, the suffering animal is afflicted
with cruel anguish, and threatened with the loss
of the use of its limbs. Against this accident, to
which they were continually liable, our provident
forefathers always kept a shrew-ash at hand, which,
when once medicated, would maintain its virtue
for ever.’ This tree, whose every branch possessed
such a potent charm, was an ash in the trunk of
which an auger-hole had been bored, and a living
shrew put into the hole, which was then closed
with a wooden plug. The incantations used when
this was done have now been forgotten; the shrew-ash
has lost its old repute; but the belief in its
virtues still lingers in some quarters, and the
belief in the dangerous bite and maleficent touch
of the shrew is strong among the country-people
in many parts of England. How confidently this
belief was entertained even by the best educated
in former times appears from many allusions to
it by old authors. It was received as an unquestionable
fact of natural history. In Topsel’s <i>History
of Four-footed Beasts and Serpents</i>, published
in 1658, it is said of the shrew, that ‘it is a ravening
beast, feigning itself gentle and tame; but
being touched, it biteth deep and poisoneth deadly;
it beareth a cruel mind, desiring to hurt anything;’
with much more of the like nature, and much
concerning medicinal virtues ascribed to this little
animal. But the belief in the deadliness of the
shrew’s bite has been transmitted from one generation
to another from times far more remote
than those of this credulous author. It prevailed
among the ancient Romans, and their remedy for
a shrew’s bite was to cut the body of the little
creature asunder and place it on the injured part.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="FLOATING-LIGHTS">FLOATING-LIGHTS.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Besides</span> the lighthouses which warn the sailor of
danger and guide him in his course amidst the
darkness of night, there are along the British
coasts numerous floating-lights or light-vessels in
situations where the erection of a lighthouse is
impossible, where there are banks or shoals perilous
to ships but affording no foundation for a
building. These vessels ride at anchor in places
that have been selected for them, and which are
as exactly marked on the charts as the positions
of the lighthouses. Most of them are stationed
off the east coast of England from the mouth of
the Humber southward; a few on other parts of
the English coast, and on that of Ireland; and
two on the coast of Scotland. They are generally
vessels of about one hundred and fifty tons,
specially constructed with a view to their riding
safely at anchor in exposed situations and during
the most severe storms, without regard to sailing-powers,
of which they have no need; and it has
been an extremely rare thing for any of them to
be driven from their moorings or to experience
any disaster. The mariner counts upon the guidance
of their light in any weather, as confidently
as he does on that of a lighthouse built upon a
rock.</p>

<p>The English floating-lights, like the English
lighthouses, are under the care and management
of Trinity House. From the Appendix to the
Report of the Royal Commission on Lights, Buoys,
and Beacons, presented to the Houses of Parliament
in 1861, we obtain some interesting information
concerning them. They are each provided
with a crew of eleven men, who have no
occupation but their professional duties; and of
whom there are at all times seven on board the
vessel, and four on shore, employed in the storehouses
at the Trinity Buoy Wharf, Blackwall.
The men remain on shore for a month at a time.
Each vessel has a master and mate, but these are
never on duty at the same time; taking the command
in turn, month about. No men are employed
in this service but such as are already good sailors;
and the men rise by seniority from the lowest rank
to that of master, so that there is a strong inducement
for them to continue in the service. Misconduct
of any kind—as disobedience of the orders
of the master or mate, quarrelling, breach of regulations,
neglect of duty, or intoxication when on
shore—is punished by censure, degradation to a
lower rank, or dismissal from the service, according
to the gravity of the offence. The lowest wage
of the men is only two pounds fifteen shillings
per month—at least so it was in 1861, and we
have heard of no change. The master has five
pounds per month and an allowance of ten pounds
a year for house-rent. All find their own provisions.
They are allowed to use beer on board
the vessel, but no spirits. They are completely
secluded from the rest of the world, whilst on
duty. No boats are allowed to go alongside the
light-vessels, and the men are strictly forbidden
to go on board any passing ship. A library is
supplied to each vessel.</p>

<p>Life in a light-vessel one would think must be
rather monotonous; but many of those who enter
the service remain long in it. Small pensions are
allowed to superannuated men or those disabled
by disease or accident. The lantern used to be
hung from the yard-arm of the vessel, but in 1807
Mr R. Stevenson introduced at the floating-light
at the Bell Rock the mode now used, in which
the lantern surrounds the mast, sliding up and
down on it, and is elevated to the top of it when
lighted. Those light-vessels which occupy the
most exposed stations ride more easily, if the
water is deep, than those which are tossed by
smaller but more frequent waves. The latter
must sometimes be rather unpleasant abodes. The
master of the Owers light-vessel, in the English
Channel, between Beachy Head and the Isle of
Wight, told the members of the Royal Commission
who visited his vessel in 1859, that in bad
weather he sometimes ‘could not lie on the floor
of his cabin without holding on to the legs of the
table.’</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
